Our research interest spans from the development of new instruments and missions for space science to radiative transfer modeling of extrasolar star systems. For our previous work, see our public library from the NASA ADS: [UASAL Publications Library](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/r6ora761TSasD0yJkA3y-g) and [team member]({{ '/Team' | relative_url}}) individual publications.

Contact [Ewan Douglas](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/ewan-douglas) if you are interested in joining our team or collaborating.

Our research is primarily funded by NASA.



To directly support our work: lowering the cost of astronomy from space and developing new technologies that help astronomers better image extrasolar planets, you can give to the [UA Foundation](https://give.uafoundation.org/science-astronomy). In the "Other" field, please type either UASAL CubeSats, UASAL Space Coronagraph Project, or Douglas Lab. For more information, contact [Cathi Duncan](cduncanf@email.arizona.edu) or Ewan Douglas.
