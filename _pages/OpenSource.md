The UASAL team is an active contributor to projects including:

- The Physical Optics Propagation in Python library, [POPPY](https://github.com/spacetelescope/poppy). A BSD licensed open source project, POPPY provides user-friendly, high-performance set of diffraction simulation tools in both the Fresnel and Fraunhofer regimes, broadly applicably but particularly well suited to astronomical telescopes and high-contrast imaging. 
- The Exoplanet Open-Source Imaging Mission Simulator,[EXOSIMS](https://github.com/dsavransky/EXOSIMS).
- pyKLIP, a python library for PSF subtraction for both exoplanet and disk imaging, [pyKLIP](https://bitbucket.org/pyKLIP/pyklip)
- poke, a python libary for Polarization Ray Tracing and Gaussian Beamlet Decomposition developed by UASAL supported by a NASA Space Technology Graduate Research Opportunity, [poke](https://github.com/Jashcraf/poke)

Members of the lab are active in many other programs, including the University of Arizona [Astronomy Camp](https://www.astronomycamp.org), the                                                                                       [Tucson Initiative for Minority Engagement in Science and TEchnology Program (TIMESTEP)](https://lavinia.as.arizona.edu/~timestep/), and [the Steward Observatory Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiative](https://sites.google.com/view/sodei).
