In order to assess the suitability of CMOS sensors for astronomical applications we have been testing a range of commercially available sensors and camera packages with our colleagues in the [UA Imagining Technology Lab](https://itl.arizona.edu/), led by Dr. Michael Lesser.

Test results to date include:

- [Sony IMX571 in ZWO ASI2600](/assets/reports//ZWO_ASI2600MM_combined_report.pdf)

- Preliminary [Sony IMX492 in ZWO ASI294](/assets/reports/CharacterizationReport__ASI292_1812911309020900.pdf.pdf)
