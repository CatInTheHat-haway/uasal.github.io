Hey folks! This is Postdoc Justin, here to announce a recent milestone achieved by one of the members of our team!

Last week, on April 15th, Jaren Ashcraft successfully defended his thesis focused on the development of open-source physical optics modeling packages, use of Gaussian Beamlet Decomposition in optical modeling, and polarization ray tracing in optical system modeling. He absolutely nailed it, in my humble opinion, and the committee thought so too! We are all so proud of him and wish him the best of luck at UC Santa Barbara, where he will continue his optical modeling work in preparation for high contrast imaging onboard the Habitable Worlds Observatory, supervised by friend-of-UASAL Dr. Max Millar-Blanchaer!

While he's still around for a few more weeks, we are all going to miss him dearly. Even though I've only joined the group relatively recently, I could immediately tell how Jaren's positive and welcoming attitude has fostered such a wonderful working environment within UASAL, and this is clearly evident in the efforts some of our group members undertook to make sure his defense was special! 
Postdoc Ramya and grad student Kian went through extra effort to obtain these awesome shirts with the logo of Jaren's open-source package PokE for the entire group, all for us to wear at his defense.

Professor Ewan also prepared a laser-etched wooden sword as a gift, intended for the so-called ``snake-fight" a PhD student may undertake as part of their dissertation defense.

*Yes, Professor Ewan gave Jaren sword-fighting lessons too.*


At any rate, congratulations to the new Dr. Ashcraft once again!! We're excited to see what the future brings you!

P.S., we're hoping to have more blog authors and more regular posts, so stay tuned!
